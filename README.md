# Mix or Match
a Halloween themed game of pairs. 

Currently set for a 1 minute countdown but this can be set in the script.js, by changing the value in let game = new MixOrMatch(100, cards) in the ready function, to any desired length.

One known bug where the animation of the card icons does not happen in webkit/Safari - still investigating this issue.

# card game war

A simple game of highest card wins round. 

Each time a player wins a card is added to their deck and when the lose a card goes to the opposition.

The game ends when one player loses all of their cards
